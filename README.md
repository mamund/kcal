# KCAL Project

## Starting Plan

### Services Summary

Design one or more hypermedia services that support the following:

* computing calories expended by a person for an activity (computation)
* computing maintenance calories for a person (computation)
* computing calorie deficit for a person (consumed - expended = deficit)
* tracking weight for a person (data collection)
* tracking calorie expenditure for a person (small database + computation)
* tracking calorie intake for a person (database problem)

### Other Constraints

* Use Windows Azure CLI tools
* Use only OSS components
* Use Vim as editing environment
* Use only “Cloud-based” services (code hosting, db hosting, source control, etc.)
* Use only hypermedia messages (state representation using collection+json, html, etc.)
* Use node.js as the server language
* Use HTML/JS/CSS as client

## Pre-game

Before showing up for the session, handle the following

* list our target services
* research topic, locate sample sites, APIs, routines, etc.
* make sure machine is ready-to-rock (azure-cli, node, git, vim)


## Actual Run-through

1. fire up console, start cmd, git, and vim windows
1. log into github and create an empty repo (kcal) w/ README
1. pull repo onto local machine
1. update README w/ main bullets
